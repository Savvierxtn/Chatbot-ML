# Chatbot-ML
This project implements an intent-based chatbot using Python, TensorFlow, and NLP. It classifies user inputs into predefined intents and returns fixed responses. The chatbot is fast, lightweight, and ideal for FAQs and rule-based customer support, demonstrating core NLP and supervised learning concepts.
